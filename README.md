Decode Neural signal as Speech
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01748.pdf
code is coming soon

In this new era, there is no common sense of training and evaluating a brain-to-text model, especially in EEG/MEG,
which can lead to some mistakes, but we are actively pushing this boundary forward and try to find out the correct path.

We are looking forward to decode sufficient information from EEG/MEG/fNIRS devices which can be portable, 
and even replace the invasive BCIs.
